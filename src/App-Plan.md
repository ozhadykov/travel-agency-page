It will be app, about traveling.

I want to do it more like a Landing page with some functionality.

It will contain one main Page with 4 or 5 sections.

This is the HOME page

1 General, like Welcoming people and the Vision of a company (what do we do)

2 Section about us like a company

3 The carousel of a Tours that we have

4 Numbers, how much clients, succesful, reviews and so on

5 Some cards from a CEO, managers, with text, that they want to help clients, getting better vacation

6 Call to action, to get a phone call, or an offer

7 FAQ

8 Contact form

I want also to have one more Pages to use React ROUTER, may be something like a TOURS carousel, so the user can choose one and get more info about it.

TOURS page

Also would be great to do something like accounts, so people could add the tours to the list and then use them.

Single Tour page or something like extending menu? -- think about it

Also Search Bar, but i m not sure, what for would it be used.(May be for searching for a Tour in a specific Land)

colors:
#495057 - grey for the main blocks or images
#ced4da - for the background
#fff - white also for the backgrounds

text-colors:
#f8f9fa - light
#343a40 - dark

Strategy:

First i will create everything with html and css. Add some Logic with React JS.

After that i want to make a branch which will contain all this project with css Modules and update React JS logic of the Site

After i want to work more on semantic html and Add Styled components

In the end i will give this WebPage life with the whole Rract JS logic
